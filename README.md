# Juice Sales Analysis
## Project Overview
This project analyzes juice sales data to extract insights and visualize trends in customer preferences, sales patterns, and other key metrics. The dataset for this analysis is collected from Kaggle and processed using Python's popular libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. The primary goal is to showcase various data analysis and visualization techniques, while drawing actionable insights from the data.

## Technologies Used
**Python**: The main programming language used for analysis.

**NumPy**: For efficient data manipulation and numerical computations.

**Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.

**Seaborn**: For creating informative and attractive statistical graphics.

**Matplotlib**: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used for this analysis is available on Kaggle. It contains information on various juice products, including sales figures, customer demographics, product details, and more. Some key columns in the dataset include:

**Product Name**: Name of the juice product.

**Sales**: The sales volume for the product.

**Date**: The date of the sale.

**Customer Demographics**: Age, gender, or location of the customers (if available).

**Price**: The price at which the juice is sold.

## Analysis Process
**Data Preprocessing**:
The raw dataset was cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
Techniques like handling outliers, converting date columns to datetime format, and filling missing values were applied.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
- Performed detailed EDA to uncover trends and patterns in juice sales. This included:

- Distribution of sales across different products.

- Correlation between product price and sales.

- Seasonal trends in juice sales.

**Data Visualizations**:
- Various types of charts and graphs were created to represent data insights, such as:

- Line charts to show sales trends over time.

- Bar charts for product comparison.

- Heatmaps to visualize correlations between variables.

- Pie charts to represent market share.

**Visualizations**
The following types of visualizations were created to provide actionable insights:

- Sales Over Time: Line plot to show how sales have changed over the weeks/months.

- Product Sales Comparison: Bar plot comparing total sales of each juice product.

- Sales Distribution: Histogram to visualize the distribution of sales values.

- price vs Sales Correlation: Scatter plot to analyze the relationship between price and sales.

These visualizations help provide a clear understanding of juice sales patterns, and assist in making data-driven decisions for inventory management, pricing strategy, and more.
